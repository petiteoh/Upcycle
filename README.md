# Upcycle

## Background and Overview

At our core, Upcycle is a social sharing and media service designed to enable and inspire creative reuse of everyday "waste" into something of higher value! On Upcycle, users -- or as we call it Zero Heroes, are rewarded with badges by accumulating Hero Points based on their upcycled projects and engagements. Join our community of Zero Heroes to discover unimaginable upcycled creations shared by the world for the world we love.
